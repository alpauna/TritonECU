## Architecture

### Dual-Core Split

**Core 1 -- Real-Time Engine Control** (dedicated FreeRTOS task via `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore`):
- Crank/cam ISR (hardware timer capture)
- RPM calculation
- Spark timing (dwell + fire)
- Injector timing (pulse width)
- No WiFi, no logging, no heap allocation on this core

**Core 0 -- Application** (Arduino loop + TaskScheduler):
- Sensor ADC reads (O2, MAP, TPS, CLT, IAT, battery voltage)
- Fuel/ignition table lookups and tuning calculations
- O2 closed-loop AFR correction
- CJ125 wideband heater state machine
- Alternator PID control
- Web server, MQTT, logging, config, OTA

Cores communicate via shared `EngineState` struct with volatile fields.

## CJ125 Wideband O2 Controller

Dual-bank Bosch CJ125 SPI controller driving two LSU 4.9 wideband lambda sensors. Disabled by default (`cj125Enabled = false` in config). When disabled, SensorManager falls back to linear 0-5V to AFR 10-20 mapping from GPIO3/4.

**Heater state machine** (non-blocking, per bank):

```
IDLE -> WAIT_POWER (battery > 11V) -> CALIBRATING -> CONDENSATION (2V, 5s)
    -> RAMP_UP (8.5V -> 13V at +0.4V/s) -> PID (heater regulation, readings valid)
    -> ERROR (diagnostic failure)
```

- SPI protocol: 16-bit frames at 125kHz SPI_MODE1, chip select via MCP23S17 #0 P8/P9
- PID heater control: P=120, I=0.8, D=10, integral clamped +/-250
- Lambda lookup: 23-point piecewise-linear interpolation from Bosch LSU 4.9 Ip characteristic curve
- Decimation: `update()` called every 10ms from ECU, CJ125 logic executes every 100ms

The CJ125 SPI register constants and PID tuning values are derived from the [Lambda Shield](https://github.com/Bylund/Lambda-Shield-Example) project by Bylund.

## I/O Expanders

The ECU extends GPIO capacity through 6x Microchip MCP23S17 SPI GPIO expanders, all sharing a single HSPI bus and a single chip select (CS) line. Each device is addressed individually via 3-bit hardware addressing (HAEN). All pin operations route through `xDigitalWrite()` / `xDigitalRead()` / `xPinMode()` which automatically dispatch to native GPIO or SPI expander based on pin number.

### Shared CS with Hardware Addressing (HAEN)

All 6 MCP23S17 devices share the same 4 SPI wires (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CS). When CS goes LOW, all chips see the SPI traffic, but only the chip whose hardware address matches the address in the SPI command byte responds. The address is set by tying each chip's A0/A1/A2 pins to VCC (3.3V) or GND on the PCB — no additional logic or components required.

**SPI command byte format:**

```
Bit:    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
        0    1    0    0   A2   A1   A0   R/W
        ─────────────────  ──────────────  ───
        Fixed prefix       Hardware addr   0=write, 1=read
```

**Hardware address wiring:**

| Device | A2 | A1 | A0 | Addr | Wiring |
|--------|----|----|-----|------|--------|
| #0 | GND | GND | GND | 0 | All three to ground |
| #1 | GND | GND | VCC | 1 | A0 to 3.3V |
| #2 | GND | VCC | GND | 2 | A1 to 3.3V |
| #3 | GND | VCC | VCC | 3 | A0 + A1 to 3.3V |
| #4 | VCC | GND | GND | 4 | A2 to 3.3V |
| #5 | VCC | GND | VCC | 5 | A2 + A0 to 3.3V |

The A0/A1/A2 pins are dedicated address pins, separate from the 16 I/O pins (GPA0-7, GPB0-7). No I/O capacity is lost — each chip provides 16 full I/O pins regardless of address configuration.

### Device Allocation and Priority

Devices are numbered by priority — input-focused chips get the lowest addresses and are scanned first during interrupt handling. Output-only chips are scanned last since they rarely (if ever) generate interrupts.

| Device | Pins | Purpose | Interrupt Priority |
|--------|------|---------|--------------------|
| #0 (addr 0) | 200-215 | General I/O — fuel pump, tach, CEL, CJ125 CS, custom inputs | **Highest** — scan first |
| #1 (addr 1) | 216-231 | Transmission solenoids (SS-A/B/C/D) + spare I/O | High |
| #2 (addr 2) | 232-247 | Expansion — custom I/O, user-defined pins | Medium |
| #3 (addr 3) | 248-263 | Expansion — custom I/O, user-defined pins | Medium |
| #4 (addr 4) | 264-279 | Coils 1-8 (P0-P7), 8 spare (P8-P15) | **Low** — output only |
| #5 (addr 5) | 280-295 | Injectors 1-8 (P0-P7), 8 spare (P8-P15) | **Lowest** — output only |

**Recommendation:** Configure input-responsive functions (custom pin ISR, digital switch inputs, feedback signals) on devices #0-#3. Reserve devices #4-#5 for outputs only (coils, injectors). This ensures interrupt scanning prioritizes chips that are most likely to have pending state changes.

### Shared Open-Drain Interrupt Line

All 6 MCP23S17 INTA pins are wired together to a single ESP32 GPIO (default GPIO 15) via an open-drain bus with a 10kΩ pull-up resistor to 3.3V. This provides pin-change interrupt detection across all 96 expander pins using just one ESP32 GPIO.

**Wiring diagram:**

```
                             10kΩ
                       3.3V ──┤├──┬── ESP32 GPIO 15 (INPUT_PULLUP, FALLING edge)
                                  │
  MCP#0 INTA (open-drain) ───────┤
  MCP#1 INTA (open-drain) ───────┤
  MCP#2 INTA (open-drain) ───────┤
  MCP#3 INTA (open-drain) ───────┤
  MCP#4 INTA (open-drain) ───────┤
  MCP#5 INTA (open-drain) ───────┘
```

**How it works:**

1. Each chip is configured with IOCON bits: **MIRROR=1** (INTA covers both ports A and B), **ODR=1** (open-drain output), **INTPOL=0** (active-low)
2. When any enabled pin changes state on any chip, that chip pulls the shared line LOW
3. The ESP32 FALLING-edge ISR fires and sets a volatile flag
4. In the main `update()` loop, the firmware scans chips in priority order (#0 first, #5 last):
   - Read **INTF** register (2 bytes) — bitmask of which pins triggered
   - Read **INTCAP** register (2 bytes) — captured pin values at time of interrupt (also clears the interrupt)
   - Skip chips with GPINTEN = 0x0000 (no interrupts enabled, typically output-only chips #4/#5)
5. Matched pin changes are dispatched to custom pin ISR handlers

**Performance:** Scanning all 6 chips takes ~25μs at 10 MHz SPI (6 x 2 register reads x 3 bytes each). In practice, only chips with GPINTEN > 0 are scanned, so output-only chips add zero overhead.

**Why open-drain?** Push-pull interrupt outputs cannot be wired together — if one chip drives HIGH while another drives LOW, you get a short circuit. Open-drain outputs only pull LOW or float, so any chip can assert the shared line without conflict. The 10kΩ pull-up returns the line to HIGH when no interrupts are pending.

### SPI Performance

The custom thin SPI driver operates at 10 MHz with shadow registers, achieving ~3-5μs per write vs ~30μs with the Adafruit library at 1 MHz. Shadow registers (local copy of OLAT) eliminate read-modify-write cycles — each pin change is a single 3-byte SPI write. The MCP3204 ADC (1 MHz, SPI_MODE0) coexists on the same HSPI bus; `beginTransaction()` sets the clock and mode per-device.

### Ghost Device Detection

SPI expanders are probed during `begin()` by writing IOCON (with HAEN=1, MIRROR=1, ODR=1) and reading it back. A real device returns the written value; a missing/ghost device returns 0xFF or 0x00. Devices that fail probe are marked not-ready and all pin operations become no-ops.

### Runtime Health Monitoring

`PinExpander::healthCheck()` probes all initialized devices every ~1 second by reading the IOCON register via SPI. Failed devices are reported as a bitmask in `expanderFaults` and trigger limp mode. The health check accepts the configured IOCON value (0x68 = HAEN+MIRROR+ODR) as valid.

### Level Shifting (3.3V ESP32 to 5V MCP23S17)

The MCP23S17 devices operate at 5V for compatibility with automotive solenoid drivers (BTS3134, ULN2803) and 5V sensors. The ESP32-S3 operates at 3.3V. Level shifting is required because the MCP23S17's CMOS input threshold at 5V is VIH = 0.7 x VDD = 3.5V, which exceeds the ESP32's 3.3V output HIGH.

**TXB0108 for data lines (SCK, MOSI, MISO):**

The TI TXB0108 bidirectional level shifter handles the four SPI data lines (SCK, MOSI, MISO, and the shared interrupt line). The TXB0108 uses internal current sources (~4mA) to auto-detect data direction, which works well for signals without external pull-ups or with pull-ups >= 50k ohm.

**MOSFET for CS line (cannot use TXB0108):**

The shared CS line has a 10k ohm pull-up to 5V (required for reliable idle-HIGH when CS is not driven). This pull-up is too strong for the TXB0108 -- its ~4mA current source cannot overcome the pull-up current, causing the output to latch HIGH and never drive LOW. TI's datasheet specifies external pull-ups must be > 50k ohm.

Instead, a discrete N-channel MOSFET (L2N7002SLLT1G) in source-follower configuration provides reliable level shifting for the CS line:

```
         Q4 — CS Level Shifter

         3.3V                          5V
          |                             |
         [R] R51 10k                   [R] R52 10k
          |                             |
     G ---+                        D ---+--- MCP23S17_CS (all 6)
     |    |                        |
     Q4 L2N7002SLLT1G             Q4
     |    |                        |
     S ---+--- ESP32 GPIO 13      (same FET)
```

- **Gate (G):** Tied to 3.3V rail
- **Source (S):** ESP32 GPIO 13 with R51 (10k) pull-up to 3.3V
- **Drain (D):** MCP23S17 CS (all 6 tied together) with R52 (10k) pull-up to 5V

**How it works:**

| ESP32 CS | Source (V) | Vgs (V) | FET | Drain (5V side) | MCP23S17 CS |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| LOW (0V) | 0V | 3.3V (on) | ON | ~0V (pulled low through FET) | LOW (selected) |
| HIGH (3.3V) | 3.3V | 0V (off) | OFF | 5V (pulled up by R52) | HIGH (deselected) |

The MOSFET adds < 5ns propagation delay and < 1 ohm on-resistance (Rds_on), which is negligible at 10 MHz SPI. The 10k pull-up on the drain provides the HIGH level and also serves as the idle pull-up for the shared CS bus.

**Why not a simple resistor divider?** CS is bidirectional in the sense that the idle state is maintained by the pull-up, not actively driven. A resistor divider would fight the pull-up and waste current. The MOSFET cleanly switches between driven-LOW and pulled-HIGH.

**MOSFET for RESET line (active reset from ESP32 EN):**

A second L2N7002SLLT1G drives all 6 MCP23S17 RESET pins from the ESP32 EN signal. Same source-follower topology as CS -- both EN and RESET are active-LOW, so the non-inverting level shifter gives correct polarity. A 100nF gate capacitor (C76) delays the gate charge at power-on, preventing a RESET glitch while the 3.3V rail ramps.

```
         Q5 — RESET Level Shifter

         3.3V                          5V
          |                             |
         [R] R55 10k                   [R] R56 10k
          |                             |
     G ---+---||--- GND           D ---+--- MCP23S17_RESET (all 6)
     |   C76 100nF                |
     Q5 L2N7002SLLT1G            Q5
     |    |                       |
     S ---+--- ESP32 EN          (same FET)
```

- **Gate (G):** 3.3V rail with C76 (100nF) to GND
- **Source (S):** ESP32 EN pin with R55 (10k) pull-up to 3.3V
- **Drain (D):** MCP23S17 RESET (all 6 tied together) with R56 (10k) pull-up to 5V

| ESP32 EN | Source (V) | Vgs (V) | FET | Drain (5V side) | MCP23S17 RESET |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| LOW (reset) | 0V | 3.3V (on) | ON | ~0V | LOW (devices reset) |
| HIGH (running) | 3.3V | 0V (off) | OFF | 5V (pulled up by R56) | HIGH (devices run) |

**Gate capacitor C76:** At cold power-on, the 100nF cap delays the gate voltage rise, preventing a brief RESET glitch while the 3.3V rail ramps. On warm reset (EN cycles but 3.3V stays up), the gate is already charged so the cap has no effect -- RESET releases as soon as EN goes HIGH. If additional hold time is needed on warm reset, a small cap (100nF-1uF) can be added on the drain side (RESET to GND) to slow the R56 charge-up.

**Why active RESET matters:** Without active RESET, the MCP23S17s retain their last output state across an ESP32 software reset / WDT / panic. Coils and injectors could stay energized for the ~100-500ms it takes the ESP32 to reboot and call `PinExpander::begin()`. With EN driving RESET, all outputs go to high-Z (IODIR resets to 0xFFFF) the instant the ESP32 enters reset.

**Bill of materials for level shifting:**

| TXB0108PWR (TSSOP-20) | 1 | 8-bit bidirectional level shifter for SCK, MOSI, MISO, INT |
| L2N7002SLLT1G (SOT-23) | 2 | N-channel MOSFETs: Q4 for CS, Q5 for RESET |
| R51, R55 — 10k ohm 0402 | 2 | Source pull-ups to 3.3V (CS, RESET) |
| R52, R56 — 10k ohm 0402 | 2 | Drain pull-ups to 5V (CS, RESET) |

### I2C Bus (ADS1115 only)

With all GPIO expanders on SPI, the I2C bus (SDA=GPIO0, SCL=GPIO42) is used exclusively for the ADS1115 ADCs. This eliminates bus contention between expander I/O and ADC reads, improving MAP/TPS sampling reliability at 860 SPS.

| Device | Address | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ADS1115 #0 | 0x48 | CJ125_UR (CH0/1), TFT temp (CH2), MLPS (CH3) |
| ADS1115 #1 | 0x49 | MAP (CH0), TPS (CH1) — frees GPIO 5/6 for OSS/TSS |

## Safe Mode

The ECU includes boot loop detection and per-peripheral enable/disable to recover from hardware faults without reflashing.

**Boot loop detection:** An `RTC_NOINIT_ATTR` counter persists across soft resets, watchdog timeouts, and panic reboots (reset on power-on). If the counter exceeds 3, the ECU enters safe mode automatically. A 30-second stability timer resets the counter after a successful boot.

**Safe mode behavior:** Skips `ECU::configure()`, `ECU::begin()`, tune table loading, MQTT, and state publishing. Retains WiFi, web server, FTP, logger, config save, and CPU load monitoring -- allowing remote configuration changes to fix the problem.

**Peripheral control:** Eight individual enable flags (persisted to `peripherals.*` in config JSON) allow disabling specific I2C or SPI devices:

| Flag | Controls | Default |
|------|----------|---------|
| `i2cEnabled` | I2C bus (ADS1115 ADCs) | true |
| `spiExpandersEnabled` | HSPI bus (all 6 MCP23S17) | true |
| `expander0Enabled` - `expander5Enabled` | Individual MCP23S17 #0-#5 | true |

**Web interface:** The config page has a "Peripherals & Safe Mode" fieldset with checkboxes (master bus disable greys out children). A red banner appears on the dashboard in safe mode with boot count, reset reason, and an "Exit Safe Mode" button. `POST /safemode/clear` clears the flag and reboots. `proj.forceSafeMode` is a one-shot flag to enter safe mode on next reboot.

## Limp Mode

Limp mode protects the engine when critical sensors fail, I/O expanders go offline, or oil pressure drops. When active, it reduces the rev limit (default 3000 RPM), caps ignition advance (default 10 deg), locks the current transmission gear, unlocks TCC, and turns on the check engine light.

**Fault sources** (bitmask in `limpFaults`):

| Bit | Constant | Trigger |
|-----|----------|---------|
| 0x01 | `FAULT_MAP` | MAP reading outside configurable min/max range |
| 0x02 | `FAULT_TPS` | TPS reading outside configurable min/max range |
| 0x04 | `FAULT_CLT` | Coolant temp exceeds configurable max |
| 0x08 | `FAULT_IAT` | Intake air temp exceeds configurable max |
| 0x10 | `FAULT_VBAT` | Battery voltage below configurable min |
| 0x20 | `FAULT_EXPANDER` | Any initialized I2C/SPI expander fails health check |
| 0x40 | `FAULT_OIL` | Low oil pressure while engine running |

**Recovery:** All faults must clear for a configurable recovery delay (default 5 seconds) before limp mode exits. This prevents rapid cycling from intermittent faults.

**Oil pressure sensor:** Configurable as disabled (default), digital switch, or analog sender:

- **Digital mode:** GPIO pin with internal pull-up. Configurable polarity (`oilPressureActiveLow`, default true). LOW = low pressure fault.
- **Analog mode:** Reads voltage from MCP3204 SPI ADC (priority) or native GPIO (fallback). Linear conversion: 0.5V = 0 PSI, 4.5V = max PSI (configurable, default 100). Faults when PSI drops below threshold (default 10 PSI).
- **Engine-running guard:** Oil pressure is only checked when RPM >= 400, with a configurable startup delay (default 3 seconds) to allow pressure to build after engine start.

**MQTT:** Limp state and fault bitmask published in `ecu/state`. Fault enter/exit events published to `ecu/fault`.

**Dashboard:** Red limp mode banner with per-fault pills (MAP, TPS, CLT, IAT, VBAT, EXP, OIL). Oil pressure card shows live PSI value and OK/LOW status (auto-hidden when oil pressure is disabled).

**Config page:** "Limp Mode" fieldset with rev limit, advance cap, recovery delay, and 7 sensor fault thresholds. "Oil Pressure" fieldset with mode dropdown and mode-dependent field visibility. All sensor thresholds are live (no reboot). Oil pressure mode and pin changes require reboot.
